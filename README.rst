RGB Nikola
==========

Seeing how hard it would be to import my Hugo content to Nikola and build from there.

Requirements
============

I mean.
Nikola, obviously.

But some content requires AsciiDoctor_.
Until I either rewrite it in RST or asciidoc-py3_ becomes generally available, this site needs Ruby and AsciiDoctor.

_AsciiDoctor: https://asciidoctor.org/
_asciidoc-py3: https://github.com/asciidoc/asciidoc-py3
