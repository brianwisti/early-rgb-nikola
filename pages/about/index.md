I dump stuff on this site: programming notes, TODO items, crafting projects, random thoughts.

My name is Brian Wisti, and I am a geek.
This site should provide plenty of evidence for that.
I write code for a living, and often write code as a hobby.

Different versions of this site have been online since sometime in 2000.
I collect notes, projects, and somewhat random thoughts here.
I try to keep tutorial material up to date.
Sometimes I fall behind, though.
[Contact](/contact/) me if you see anything horribly wrong.

I have more hobbies than I know what to do with.
These days, I spend a lot of time programming, [knitting](/tags/knitting), or [drawing](/tags/drawing).
I spend more time programming, but it is hard to tell whether I have been programming or drawing for more time.
They both seem to satisfy my general urge to create something.
From other people, each gets a different reaction.
More people go "oh, cool" at my drawings.
More people are willing to pay me for my programming.
The knitted stuff keeps people warm and / or amused.

So I get to do all the things I enjoy and stay happy.
