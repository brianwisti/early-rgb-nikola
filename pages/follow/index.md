Follow the blog, and maybe follow me personally on social networks.

## The Site

I automatically share new posts on [Mastodon][] and [Twitter][].
[RSS][] is the best way to follow this site, though.
It works even when my announcement scripts don't.

An RSS file summarizes recent updates on a site.
Feed reader apps,
such as [Feedly][] (web), [Newsflow][] (Windows), [FeedReader][] (Linux), or [NetNewsWire][] (macOS),
let you subscribe to all the sites you like, letting you read updates on your own schedule.

Subscribe to the Random Geekery blog by copying and pasting one of the below links —
the link itself, not the xml file you see if you click the link —
into your feed reader app!

[Feedly]: https://feedly.com
[NetNewsWire]: https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/
[Newsflow]: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/newsflow/9nblggh58s5r
[FeedReader]: https://jangernert.github.io/FeedReader/

The Main Feed
: The [main feed](/index.xml) includes everything on the site, including my experiments with new non-post content types.

The Post Feed
: The [post feed](/post/index.xml) is basically the blog. Posts about code, craft, and whatever else is on my mind.

The Notes Feed
: The [notes feed](/note/index.xml) is for my [notes](/note) experiment. Small posts, informal, more frequent than full blog bosts.

The Craft Feed
: The [craft feed](/categories/craft/index.xml) is the blog with less code, more knitting and drawing.

## Me

My personal social media accounts tend towards chaos. Sometimes I flood them with activity. Sometimes I ignore
them for weeks or months. I'm out there, though. Here are the accounts I pay more attention to, from most to
least frequently checked.

[Mastodon][]
: Let friends and strangers who enjoy niche social networks know that I'm alive and enjoy niche social networks. [Join in](https://joinmastodon.org/) and try it out! It's mostly like Twitter.

[Twitter][]
: Let friends and strangers know that I'm alive and want coffee.

[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/brianwisti)
: The usual: let friends and family know I'm still alive. Stuff like that.

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianwisti/)
: Let peers and strangers know that I can occasionally look professional.

[Github](https://github.com/brianwisti)
: Some people only care about your code. Warning: unreliable as an indicator of the code I'm working on.
