**If my activities or priorities change, I'll update this page.**

Checkout the [/now page movement](https://sivers.org/nowff) started by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/). You can get a
[profile](https://nownownow.com/p/2ugf) if you set up a `/now` page. [now](https://nownownow.com/) -- it's like a [webring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring) for
status pages!

I live in the [Chinatown - International District](http://cidbia.org) neighborhood of
 [Seattle](https://www.seattle.gov/visiting-seattle) and write code - not too much, mostly [Python](/tags/python) - for [Coffee
 Meets Bagel](https://coffeemeetsbagel.com).

There is a page [about me](/about/) and the site if you want general information.

What about more specifically?

- Working a lot while also enjoying a [happy relationship]({{< ref "note/2019-07-21-0171/index.md" >}})
- Experimenting with alternate builders for this site. Feeling the itch after a few years of [Hugo](/tags/hugo).
- Exploring [Emacs](/tags/emacs) and [org](/tags/org), which as usual seems to end up with me making my [vim](/tags/vim)
  configuration more intricate.
-   Learning [Go](/tags/go) but also [Crystal](/tags/crystal).
-   Still have [some](/tags/buy-me) of my [drawings](/tags/drawing) and [sketches](/hashtags/drawing) in a Design By HÃ¼mans [store](https://www.designbyhumans.com/shop/randomgeek/), where you can buy them on shirts, mugs, and
    more. Guiltily reminding myself I wanted to add more.
-   Figuring out how to better integrate my [Notes](/note) experiment in [microblogging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging) with the rest of the
    site.
-   Using a combination of medical help and [task management tools](/tags/taskwarrior) to direct my easily distracted brain.
