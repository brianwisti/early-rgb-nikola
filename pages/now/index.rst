I live in the `Chinatown - International District`_ neighborhood of Seattle_ and write code —
not too much, mostly Python_ —
for `Coffee Meets Bagel`_.

.. _about me: /about/

There is a page `about me`_ and the site if you want general information.

What about more specifically?

- Working a lot while also enjoying a `happy relationship`_.
- Losing sleep pretty much nightly thanks to loud cars.
  Turns out my block is a Seattle street racing hot spot.
- Experimenting with alternate builders such as Nikola_ for this site.
  Gatsby_ looks cool too.
  Feeling the itch after a few years of Hugo_.
- Diving deeper into Python_ so I can get better at work, but also playing with Crystal_.
  It's fast and just so *pretty*.
- Still have some_ of my drawings_ in a Design By Hümans store_, where you can buy them on shirts, mugs, and more.
  Guiltily reminding myself I wanted to add some sketches to the store.
- Figuring out how to better integrate my Notes_ experiment in microblogging_ with the rest of the site.
- Using a combination of medical help and `task management tools`_ to direct my easily distracted brain.
