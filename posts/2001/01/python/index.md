<!-- TEASER_END -->
You may have already heard me say that I do not have a favorite programming 
language. That's true.

However, if you want to learn how to program - if you have never programmed 
before in your life (except maybe some QBASIC several years ago) - than Python 
sticks out way way ahead of the others. It is easy to get started, it is 
consistent across most operating systems, and you can make your programs as 
big, elaborate, and "real-world" as you want.

There are already a lot of Python tutorials out there, aimed towards a broad 
range of abilities. I've made my own contribution, intended for the person who 
is just about to install Python on their machine, and has no idea how to use 
the language or the tools that come with it.
