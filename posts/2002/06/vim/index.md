[Emacs]: /tags/emacs/

[Vim](http://www.vim.org/ "Vim Main Site") is one of the two major editors 
of the UNIX world. The other one is [Emacs][],
which I am also quite fond of. Still, it's hard to beat Vim. It may be 
awkward, ugly, and hard to use, but there's just something inescapable about 
it. Regular expressions are a major part of the editing interface, which gives 
you a great deal of (admittedly cryptic) power.
<!-- TEASER_END -->

Emacs and Vim get equal time in my work. I probably shouldn't admit that in a 
public forum, since a statement like that is nearly considered blasphemous by 
devotees of each application. Emacs has a lot of power as an environment, but 
I still find Vim to be the more powerful *editor*. So which one I'll use 
depends on the scope of my work that day. It will be Emacs if I need to do 
remote editing, email checking, project management, and other such tasks which 
are not specifically editing. However, the choice will be Vim if I just want to 
sit down and bang some code out in quick order with minimal distractions. Make 
your own choice, and have fun with it. And remember, you can use 
`viper-mode` if all you're looking for is vi-style finger movement.

Ages ago, I had my own copy of the online Vim documentation on the site. 
It was a simple affair, and was intended to provide some filler 
for the site. Show I could do text formatting, stuff like that. The problem 
is that it takes up so much space on my Web host. You're probably best off 
using the official documentation at the [VimDoc](http://vimdoc.sf.net "Vim Documentation") site.

## Cream

I recently discovered [Cream](http://cream.sf.net/ "Cream VIM Distribution"), a 
heavily customized release of Vim intended to provide all the power of Vim without 
the headache of learning about Command Mode or anything like that. Try Cream if 
you are interested in getting an easy-to-use version of one incredibly powerful 
editor.
