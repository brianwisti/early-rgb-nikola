[Perl]: /tags/perl/

[PHP](http://www.php.net/) is great. It is easy to learn and easy 
to use. Of course, it is also easy to make a project that is so amazingly 
baroque that mere humans have no chance of ever editing it. This is a trait 
that PHP shares with one of its biggest rivals, [Perl][].
It can be funny to listen to an argument 
between PHP and Perl folks about why their favorite is the best and the other 
guy is the worst. The other guy is always "unstructured and unsuitable for real 
projects", while the favorite is "fast and expressive".

These folks need to settle down, because they're both right. Perl and PHP show 
an obvious influence from the world of shell scripting, where the goal is to 
get stuff done <em>now</em>. This means that you can put together a project with 
amazing speed, but it takes a lot of discipline to keep your code in a clean, 
maintainable state. You could say that about lots of languages, though. My 
advice is that you go with PHP if that's your preference.  Don't let anybody 
bother you about your choice. It's a regular part of my site-building toolkit, 
and I'm pretty much guilt-free about it.
        
Plus, I am really excited about PHP 5, which provides many 
<a href="http://www.php.net/zend-engine-2.php">new features</a> and better 
support for object-oriented programming.
