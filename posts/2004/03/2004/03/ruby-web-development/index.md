As much as I admire the clever braintwistings of <a href="http://www.freeride.rubyforge.org/">FreeRide</a> and the many other excellent projects that are 
out there, I must admit that Web programming is what I know best. And Web 
programming is what this section is about, from the Ruby side of things. I
will take a peek at CGI programming, Embedded Ruby, setting up servers, and 
anything else I can think of that will make it easier for you to use Ruby as
a major component of developing your Web applications.
