[Perl]: /tags/perl/

I'll admit it. When I first got into Web programming, 
[JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) was not my 
favorite language. It took too much work to get anything done, and then it 
wouldn't work half the time on other browsers. That's the other thing. It was 
only useful to most of us on Web browsers. [Perl][] was 
funny-looking, but worked on nearly any machine and could make the most 
elaborate Web applications that worked regardless of what browser your visitor 
was using. You could even write applications that had nothing to do with the 
Web, using Perl/Tk and CPAN.

Well that was 1997, and a lot has happened since then. Perl is still 
funny-looking and capable of nearly anything, but it's not the only language in 
town these days. I have been spending a lot of time with JavaScript lately, 
and I've been pleasantly surprised by how much the language has improved since 
I first looked at it. I'd like to spend a little time on using JavaScript. 
That's something else to tackle in my copious free time.
