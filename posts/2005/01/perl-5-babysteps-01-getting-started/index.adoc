<h2 id="_creating_perl_programs">Creating Perl Programs</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The tradition in programming literature is to start by creating a program that prints a simple phrase, such as "Hello, World!"
The idea is to give you some clue how much work is involved in creating a minimal program.
I am not going to argue with tradition.
Not this one, at least.
Type the following into your text editor:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Save the file as <code>hello.pl</code>.
We will run it in a few moments&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;but first, let’s take a quick look at what we’ve got so far.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_pod">POD</h3>
<div class="listingblock">

<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="perl"><span></span><span class="tok-cm">=head1 hello.pl</span>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>POD, or "Plain Old Documentation", is the standard system for documenting Perl programs.
POD directives exist within your application, but are ignored during execution.
They are instead processed by the <code>perldoc</code> application.
<code>perldoc</code> can convert your POD to different formats such as HTML, or simply format and display the documentation to your screen.
Use POD to write about what you want <em>users</em> to know about your Perl application.
A proper introduction to <code>perldoc</code> is far beyond the scope of this little tutorial, but you can see the potential usefulness of this tool from the console with a simple command:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="console"><span></span><span class="tok-gp">$ </span>perldoc hello.pl</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You get a simple display showing a formatted version of the POD you wrote.
There is a lot more information you can get about POD and perldoc within Perl’s own POD:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="console"><span></span><span class="tok-gp">$ </span>perldoc perlpod</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There’s also an <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlpod.html">HTML version</a> if <code>perldoc</code> is not available on your system or you just want to see something pretty.</p>

<h3 id="_comments">Comments</h3>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="perl"><span></span><span class="tok-c1"># Depends on features not in older Perls.</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On each line, everything from <code>#</code> to the end of the line is a <em>comment</em>.
Perl ignores comments, so they allow you to communicate with other people who read your code.
Comments are <em>good</em>.
When you come back to look at a complex script after a few months, you might forget what some block of code does, or why you chose one solution over another.
Having the comments there help to remind you what you were intending, and generally serve to make it much easier sorting everything out.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_use"><code>use</code></h3>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="perl"><span></span><span class="tok-k">use</span> <span class="tok-mf">5.14.0</span><span class="tok-p">;</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>use</code> statement is incredibly powerful.
It effectively changes the way Perl will behave for the duration of your program.
You can get extra functionality with <code>use</code> by loading a module, or you can significantly change the rules Perl runs under by loading a <em>pragma</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I will be taking full advantage of the <code>use</code> statement in this tutorial,
because it takes Perl from a strong shell scripting language to an incredibly powerful programming language.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Oh, about that semi-colon (<code>;</code>): <code>perl</code> uses the semi-colon to separate statements.
Each statement contains a particular instruction for the Perl language.
You will usually - but not always - see Perl code with one statement per line, with a semi-colon at the end of each line.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s get back to looking at <code>hello.pl</code></p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We use <code>say</code> to print things out on a line in Perl 5.14.
This time we’re asking Perl to say the phrase "Hello World!"".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hm.
I really thought it would take more effort to explain that.
Oh well, guess there’s nothing left to do but see it in action.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_running_it">Running it</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now you would probably like to know how to actually run your program.
Save the file you have been editing and switch to a command line.
Make sure you are in the same directory as your script - this should be as simple as <code>cd project-directory</code>.
Once you are in the right place, type the following into the command line:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="console"><span></span><span class="tok-gp">$ </span>perl hello.pl Hello, World!</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All this is kind of cool, but it would be nice to customize it a little bit.
Maybe we could change the program so that it says "Hello" to us personally.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="perl"><span></span><span class="tok-cm">=head1 hello.pl</span>

<span class="tok-cm">Displays a warm greeting.</span>

<span class="tok-cm">=cut</span>

<span class="tok-c1"># Depends on features not in older Perls.</span>
<span class="tok-k">use</span> <span class="tok-mf">5.14.0</span><span class="tok-p">;</span>

<span class="tok-n">say</span> <span class="tok-s">&quot;Hello, $name!&quot;</span><span class="tok-p">;</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We use the word <code>my</code> to declare variables.
Declaration is when we tell Perl that we have a variable we plan on using.
Perl 5.14 mode enforces the declaration of variables.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What’s a variable?
We’ll get to that in a second.
I’m impatient to see a running program! Save the file, and run it again.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="console"><span></span><span class="tok-gp">$ </span>perl hello.pl Hello, Brian!</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There, I feel better.
Let’s move on to talking about variables.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_variables">Variables</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We stored the string "Brian" in the variable <code>$name</code>.
You can think of a <em>variable</em> as a tag - a name we use for some value that we want the program to remember.
Later, we can get that value back by referring to the tag.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>$</code> symbol at the beginning tells Perl what type of value this variable will be used for.
The <em>type</em> of a variables gives clues for how it can be treated.
Most variables in Perl break down into two broad categories.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Individual things like strings and numbers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collections of things like lists and dictionaries</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Variables that refer to individual things are called <em>scalars</em> in Perl.
They are easy to recognize, because they are prefixed by a <code>$</code> symbol.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="perl"><span></span><span class="tok-k">my</span> <span class="tok-nv">$name</span> <span class="tok-o">=</span> <span class="tok-s">&quot;Brian&quot;</span><span class="tok-p">;</span> <span class="tok-c1"># I&#39;m going to use a scalar variable called &#39;name&#39;.</span>
                    <span class="tok-c1"># It has the value &quot;Brian&quot;.</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Strings</em>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;scalar values intended to be handled like simple text&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;are always quoted in some way to show where the text of the string begins and where it ends.
There are many ways to quote a string, but for now I will use double-quote characters.
That is what quoted text looks like in American English, so it is easy for me to remember.
It also provides some other conveniences when displaying variables, such as when we say <code>"Hello, $name"</code> later in the program.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyways, this single line both declares the variable <code>$name</code>, letting Perl know you plan on using it, and assigns a value to <code>$name</code>, so that Perl will have something to remember.
What happens if you skip one or both of these steps?
It depends, so the best thing to do is try it and see.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="perl"><span></span><span class="tok-cm">=head1 hello.pl</span>

<span class="tok-cm">Displays a warm greeting.</span>

<span class="tok-cm">=cut</span>

<span class="tok-k">use</span> <span class="tok-mf">5.14.0</span><span class="tok-p">;</span>

<span class="tok-n">say</span> <span class="tok-s">&quot;Hello, $name!&quot;</span><span class="tok-p">;</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We’ve removed the declaration and assignment.
Let’s see what happens now.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="shell-session"><span></span><span class="tok-gp">$ </span>perl hello.pl
<span class="tok-go">Global symbol &quot;$name&quot; requires explicit package name at hello.pl line 12.</span>
<span class="tok-go">Execution of hello.pl aborted due to compilation errors.</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because we insisted on 5.14, Perl politely informed us that it found some mention of a variable called <code>$name</code> that we never declared.
This is considered rude by recent Perls, so the interpreter quit without running the program.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Okay, what if we declare <code>$name</code> but never assign a value to it?</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="perl"><span></span><span class="tok-k">use</span> <span class="tok-mf">5.014</span><span class="tok-p">;</span>

<span class="tok-k">my</span> <span class="tok-nv">$name</span><span class="tok-p">;</span>
<span class="tok-n">say</span> <span class="tok-s">&quot;Hello, $name!&quot;</span><span class="tok-p">;</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This time Perl runs, but the results are confusing.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="console"><span></span><span class="tok-gp">$ </span>perl hello.pl Hello, !</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since <code>$name</code> has no value, Perl has nothing to put in that string.
That’s exactly what it puts there: nothing.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_use_warnings"><code>use warnings;</code></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Perl generally assumes that you know what you are doing.
It will not argue with you if you want to use a variable that has no value.
However, that behavior is not always helpful.
Using a variable without a value is usually a mistake, and it can often be a very difficult mistake to track down.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is why Perl provides the <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/warnings.html">warnings pragma</a>.
If you enable warnings, you will be told about common mistakes like these.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="perl"><span></span><span class="tok-k">use</span> <span class="tok-mf">5.014</span><span class="tok-p">;</span>
<span class="tok-k">use</span> <span class="tok-nn">warnings</span><span class="tok-p">;</span>

<span class="tok-k">my</span> <span class="tok-nv">$name</span><span class="tok-p">;</span>
<span class="tok-n">say</span> <span class="tok-s">&quot;Hello, $name!&quot;</span><span class="tok-p">;</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That addition makes Perl much friendlier for learners or people with large, unpredictable applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="console"><span></span><span class="tok-gp">$ </span>perl name.pl
<span class="tok-go">Use of uninitialized value $name in concatenation (.) or string at name.pl line 5.</span>
<span class="tok-go">Hello, !</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The combined behavior of <code>use 5.14.0;</code> and <code>use warnings;</code> may not seem like much right now, but they are vital when working with large applications that have thousands of lines of code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With these behaviors enabled we have told Perl to behave more like a powerful application programming language with Perl’s latest features instead of as a quick and handy tool for system administrators.
Decide for yourself whether that transformation is important to you, but all of my code in this tutorial will use both of these pragmas.</p>
