This section contains articles on various random ideas that I had as I was 
learning REBOL. They didn't really fit in the context of the [tutorial][] 
or any of the general pages in the [top REBOL section][] suppose they are 
counterparts to the [Moderately Interesting Ruby Exercises][] more than
anything else. I hope they provide some general ideas and inspiration for
other potential REBOLlers.
