<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section contains articles on various random ideas that I had as I was learning REBOL.
They didnâ€™t really fit in the context of the <a href="/post/2004/12/rebol-babysteps/">tutorial</a> or any of the general pages in the <a href="/tags/rebol">top REBOL section</a>.
I suppose they are counterparts to the <a href="/post/2004/09/the-mires">Moderately Interesting Ruby Exercises</a> more than anything else.
I hope they provide some general ideas and inspiration for other potential REBOLlers.</p>
