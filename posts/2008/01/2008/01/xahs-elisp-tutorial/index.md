<p>I'd <em>really</em> love to master an editor. Any editor. <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> has been my weapon
   of choice for years, but <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> has always intrigued me.
   It's easier to use than Vim, but the Elisp language is the real draw. Vim's configuration / 
   scripting language is awkward at best. Elisp is cryptically lispish, but at least it is
   possible to break it down without wondering what the heck <code>&lt;sfile&gt;</code> is supposed to be.

<p>So yeah. I'm mostly a Vim guy but I'd love to get more out of my Emacs sessions. With that in
   mind, I'll be taking a close look at <a href="http://xahlee.org/emacs/emacs.html">Xah's Emacs</a> and
   <a href="http://xahlee.org/emacs/elisp.html">Elisp</a> tutorials.
