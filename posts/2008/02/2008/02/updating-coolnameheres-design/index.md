It's time to revamp [coolnamehere][].
<!--more-->

I've been using a tweaked version of the <a href="http://www.oswd.org/design/information/id/2448">Greenery</a>
template at <a href="http://oswd.org/">OSWD</a> for a couple of years now, and I think it's time for a change.
This time I actually concocted my own design using one of my photos and <a
href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">Yahoo's YUI</a> (I had so much fun with YUI on <a
href="http://greenlakeumc.org/">my church site</a> that I had to try it out on my own site).

Here's a screenshot of the old design:

There are a lot of things I liked about this design. The grass image dividing the columns gave the site an
attractive and natural touch that had been missing before. On the other hand, I felt the need to tweak it so
that it would work in all the browsers I used. It's nice, though. Much better than the designs I had been
coming up with on my own.

The new design has been widely praised by my sample group of two incredibly non-biased people: my wife and my
brother. Okay, I will concede that they may have a bias. I like it in general, though. It's very ... Seattle.
Clouds, water, scotch bloom.

The design is still in progress. For starters, I *hate* the navtree menu.  That navtree is starting to look a
little cumbersome, actually, and is making me rethink how I want to handle navigation through the site. Maybe
a simple subpage listing such as the one generated by ZenWeb. I'm also looking at new publishing options, and
the one that is most attractive to me right now is [Blosxom][]. It's relatively old. It is also ridiculously
easy to use and fairly straightforward to enhance.

Oh, and I need to sort through the CSS, and probably the content itself. Oh well, at least all the pages are
in order.
