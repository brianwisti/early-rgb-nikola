<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have been spending most of my free time working on a <a href="https://github.com/brianwisti/marysplace-rails">Rails project</a> for the <a href="http://www.marysplaceseattle.org/">Mary’s Place</a> day shelter.
At some point - probably after many scan/edit cycles with <a href="https://github.com/metricfu/metric_fu">metric_fu</a>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;it occurred to me that even though my Rails knowledge has increased over the last year, my core Ruby skills have not.
They have stayed static.
They may even have deteriorated a bit, since Rails does so much work for the developer.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This seems like a perfect opportunity to reread the Pickaxe book <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/ruby4/programming-ruby-1-9-2-0">Programming Ruby</a>.
This might not count as a reread, though.
I have not read it cover to cover since the second edition came out.
They are on to the fourth edition now.</p>
