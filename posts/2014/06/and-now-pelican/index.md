I know. I'm fickle. Maybe this one will stick for a while. *Edit: Nope.*

I'm not sure why, but I wasn't *quite* comfortable with [o-blog][]. It
works well enough, but decided it was time to poke around with
[jekyll][] again.

Used [exitwp][] to convert the older WordPress posts to
Markdown. Discovered that I like how Emacs handles Markdown files more
than Vim. Contemplated drinking heavily to readjust my world view,
decided against it.

Even so, I kept bumping into issues with Jekyll - that can happen with
opinionated software. Gave [Pelican][] a try, and turns out Pelican was
exactly what I was looking for.

For now.
