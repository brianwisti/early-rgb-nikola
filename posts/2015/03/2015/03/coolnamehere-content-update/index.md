I got bored of the old [coolnamehere][] pages effectively sitting outside of the site
because of the way [Jekyll][] - and pretty much every other static blogging system -
treats pages as secondary to posts. It makes sense, anyways. Once you stop bikeshedding
about where to put content in your elaborate directory structure, it gets
easier to add stuff.

So with a bit of [Ruby][] code, some time attempting to correct publishing dates on
[archive.org][], scrubbing repeatedly over internal links with [linkchecker][], and
heavy usage of the [jekyll-pageless-redirects][] plugin, the important content of
the site has a consistent presentation.

Check the [coolnamehere][] category to satisfy your historic curiosity.

And _of course_ there are still going to be issues with that old content.
