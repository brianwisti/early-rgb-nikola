I just finished my "Amicable Socks" - so named because I made them for my ex, and we split on friendly terms.

They follow directions from Charlene Schurch's [Sensational Knitted Socks][] with "Woven Stitch" as the
repeating pattern. I used [Shoalwater Bay Bamboo/Merino yarn][], which I purchased a couple years ago at the
Seattle University District Street Fair.

That takes care of the technical details, more or less. What made this project interesting enough to blog
about?

## I Kept a Journal

Knitting is detail work. You need to know how many stitches you knitted, how many more you need to knit, and
how far along the the increases or decreases you are. I usually handle this by counting stitches constantly,
getting bored, and loathing the fact that people have two feet because it means I need to knit a *second*
sock. I often take several months to finish a single pair of socks. Knitting two at the same time just
confused me more - though I plan to tackle that eventually.

I decided to log my work with the Amicable Socks. Part of that involved breaking down the generalized
instructions into something specific for my chosen pattern.

I also marked off rows as I finished them. I pondered tracking individual stitches, but realized that would
result in too much detail to be useful.

These socks took me six weeks to finish, significantly beating my previous record of 3 months. And that was
with a week and a half of idle time while I worried about whether I had enough yarn to finish the pair.

Oh, about that.

## I Weighed My Yarn

[@vmbrasseur][] suggested that I weigh my in-progress sock and the amount of remaining yarn, then compare the
two weights.

It turns out I had plenty of yarn to finish the project. This knowledge kept me moving at a steady pace even
when the yarn ball got alarmingly small.

## I Blocked Them When I Was Done

Every knitting book I read tells me to block my projects, but I never did. These socks were special, though. I
decided to block them.

  description="The important thing is the blocking, not me going crazy with filters." >}}

The result amazed me. The stitch pattern pops out. The yarn feels soft and luxurious to the touch. The socks
lay flat. I plan to block all of my future projects.

# What Next?

Next I'm going to try something else new to me. I will make socks for myself. Never did that before. I'll
log. I'll block. If I get nervous, I'll weigh.
