Thought I'd try the [Atom Editor][] on my [openSUSE][] Tumbleweed install. RPMs
and DEB files are available from the Atom site, and the RPM works just fine for
me. There's the markdown for my [iTunes ratings graph post][], a live preview,
and some sort of Git integration showing up in the sidebar.

Since I'm more of a Vim person, I don't really know what to do with Atom
just yet. I may end up not doing much of anything with it. But at least I know
it works. Go ahead and try it out if you're curious.
