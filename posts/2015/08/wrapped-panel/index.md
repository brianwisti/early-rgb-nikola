I like this one. Stretching myself with each picture is starting to look interesting.
<!-- TEASER_END -->

Started as basic Celtic knotwork practice the other day.
Put aside because I thought it needed more, but had no idea. Picked it up
this morning and apparently had ideas.

That little circle in the corner is me getting a sudden urge to try some
[George Bain][] style construction. It - well - it's not exactly what I
saw in my head, but it looks cool.
