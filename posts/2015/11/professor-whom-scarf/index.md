I know it's a silly name. See, I found a [pattern site][] for scarves from the [Doctor Who][]
TV show. http://doctorwhoscarf.com contains great patterns and solid advice throughout. This
scarf uses the pattern for the [original scarf][], with some differences.
<!--more-->

* I replaced the original scarf colors with an assortment of greens.
* It's only about 75% of the knitted rows from the pattern.

With those differences, it hardly seemed fair calling it a "Doctor Who" scarf.
