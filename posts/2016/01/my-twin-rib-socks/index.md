Took me a couple months, mainly because I started a pair for my mom while
in the middle of making this pair.

This is from Charlene Schurch's book _Sensational Knitted Socks_. Nearly
every sock I make is, to be honest. Great book. The yarn is [Cascade Yarns
Heritage Silk][] 5608 "Pine". A single 100 gram hank served almost perfectly for
my US size 10.5 feet. The amount of yarn left over (5 grams) is so small
that it's nearly a choking hazard.

I blocked these on sock hangers, but that made them look *more* lumpy. The
socks are a little larger than the hangers. You can see where the corner of
the hanger deformed them a bit at the top of the heel. I assume that will
bounce back after wearing and washing. Still - future pairs will likely get
blocked flat.

They look and feel great on my feet. For the first time I understand why
my ex was always requesting more socks.
