By special request, some fingerless gloves using a bit of every sock yarn I own.

When I offered to make a pair, my friend pointed out a pair she had seen on Etsy.
I started from a straightforward pattern in Sally Melville's
[The Knitting Experience Book 2: The Purl Stitch][].

Yes I'll try to find that pair on Etsy again at some point, because it's a great
design and people should buy that designer's stuff.
