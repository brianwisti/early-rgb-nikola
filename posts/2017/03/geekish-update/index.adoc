<p>I set up a space for myself in the basement.
This is now where I keep my desktop — running <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> at the moment.
Easy enough to get at from the laptop upstairs.
Maybe keep <a href="https://irssi.org/">Irssi</a> running in a <a href="https://tmux.github.io/">Tmux</a> session or something.</p>

<p>I’m working on a <code>test</code> rule for this site.
Mainly I use it to check for bad links in an attempt to deal with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot">link rot</a>.
The link checker is <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> with <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/">Requests</a>,
and seeing if <a href="https://scrapy.org/">Scrapy</a> can be useful in this context.
Scrapy seems like overkill at first glance, but it has middleware for respecting <a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/">robots.txt</a>.
I care about being a good Internet citizen.</p>

<p>I plan to write about that soon, since I enjoy the task so far.</p>
