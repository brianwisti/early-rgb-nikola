<p>I dunno, folks.
Over the years I have seen so much <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2017/trump-supporters-voice-real-outrage-fake-resistanceradio-promoting-amazon-tv-series/">outrage</a>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;sincere or feigned&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;on social media.
Then there’s the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/03/the-social-media-echo-chamber-is-real/">echo chamber</a> problem.
Yeah.
Nice thing about an RSS feed is that I’m guaranteed to see everything I subscribe to, but there’s no personal insult in unsubscribing.</p>

<p>I think maybe I could spend less time on Twitter and Facebook.
Not give them up.
They remain a source of great conversation.
But this nonsense takes up brain that I just can’t spare.
Some of my online friends cut themselves out completely, and <a href="https://seeknuance.com/2017/03/07/im-happier-and-more-productive-without-twitter/">they like it</a>.
Perhaps I should follow their example.
Besides, each of them that moves on means one less bit of signal in the noise.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is so much noise.</p>

<p>I noticed that the Disqus sections for all post content in 2017 are tied to <a href="/post/2017/01/cinnamon-screenshot-shortcuts/">my screenshot post</a>,
which also happens to be the first post content of 2017.
Made some adjustments and had Disqus recrawl the site.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then I decided that maybe I can do without comments for a while.</p>
