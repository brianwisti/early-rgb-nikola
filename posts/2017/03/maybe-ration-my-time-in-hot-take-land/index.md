I dunno, folks. Over the years I have seen so much [outrage][] - sincere or feigned - on social media.
Then there's the [echo chamber][] problem. Yeah. Nice thing about an RSS feed is that I'm guaranteed to see
everything I subscribe to, but there's no personal insult in unsubscribing.

I think maybe I could spend less time on Twitter and Facebook. Not give them up. They remain a source of
great conversation. But this nonsense takes up brain that I just can't spare. Some of my online friends cut
themselves out completely, and [they like it][]. Perhaps I should follow their example. Besides, each of them
that moves on means one less bit of signal in the noise.

There is so much noise.

<p>I noticed that the Disqus sections for all <tt>post</tt> content in 2017 are tied to <a
href="http://randomgeekery.org/post/2017/cinnamon-screenshot-shortcuts/">my screenshot post</a>, which also
happens to be the first <tt>post</tt> content of 2017. Made some adjustments and having Disqus recrawl the
site.</p>

<p>Then I decided that maybe I can do without comments for a while.</p>
