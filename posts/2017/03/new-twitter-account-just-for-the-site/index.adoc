<p>Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/randgeeekery">@randgeekery</a> if Twitter is your news feed.</p>

<p>As of 2020-01-31, I haven’t updated that twitter account in about two years.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is relevant to my earlier <a href="/post/2017/03/maybe-ration-my-time-in-hot-take-land/">post about limiting social media</a>.
See, if Twitter gets scary enough that I want to lock down <a href="https://twitter.com/brianwisti/">my personal account</a>,
I’ll still have this one for sharing posts.
Plenty of folks use Twitter as their news feed.
And honestly the way I tweet it’s easy to lose any site-related content in the GIFs, jokes, and existential despair.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>For now the new account exists mainly to be retweeted by me&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and maybe the two friends that found it even though I haven’t posted anything yet.
In the future?
Who knows? I’ve been just <a href="https://twitter.com/brianwisti">@brianwisti</a> for nearly ten years now.
I might enjoy the change of pace.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the spirit of streamlining, I added a <a href="/follow/">Follow</a> page for RSS and social media links,
and cleaned up the sidebar links a bit.</p>
