<!-- TEASER_END -->

This is relevant to my earlier [post about limiting social media][]. See, if Twitter gets scary enough that I
want to lock down [my personal account][], I'll still have this one for sharing posts. Plenty of folks use
Twitter as their news feed. And honestly the way I tweet it's easy to lose any site-related content in the
GIFs, jokes, and existential despair.

For now the new account exists mainly to be retweeted by me - and maybe the two friends that found it even
though I haven't posted anything yet. In the future? Who knows? I've been just [@brianwisti][] for nearly ten
years now. I might enjoy the change of pace.

In the spirit of streamlining, I added a [Follow][] page for RSS and social media links, and cleaned up the
sidebar links a bit.
