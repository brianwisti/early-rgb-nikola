My [main code hobby project][] is for [Mary's Place][], a local homeless
shelter network in Seattle. It was immensely satisfying to see their
director's face when I visited Amazon this morning.

Way back when I contracted at Amazon, and their apparent lack of community engagement at the time annoyed me
endlessly. Not only have they improved in that domain recently, but I approve of at least one
organization they focus on :thumbsup:

From the [Amazon feature][]:

[Amazon feature]: https://www.amazon.com/p/feature/z4sbqvckkdgq4w9

> Mary's Place announced today that Amazon will donate more than 47,000 sq.
> ft. of space within Amazonâ€™s newest headquarters building as a permanent
> location for a Mary's Place Family Shelter. This first-of-its-kind
> partnership will include 65 rooms, which will shelter more than 200
> homeless women, children, and families each night.

Very happy for Mary's Place. Of course, this just reminds me of all the stuff I still had on my TODO for that hobby project!

More details in a [blog post][] on the Mary's Place site.
