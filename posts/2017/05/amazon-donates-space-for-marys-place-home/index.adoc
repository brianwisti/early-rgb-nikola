<p>My <a href="https://github.com/brianwisti/marysplace-rails">main code hobby project</a> is for <a href="http://www.marysplaceseattle.org">Mary’s Place</a>, a local homeless shelter network in Seattle. It was immensely satisfying to see their director’s face when I visited Amazon this morning.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Way back when I contracted at Amazon, and their apparent lack of community engagement at the time annoyed me endlessly.
Not only have they improved in that domain recently, but I approve of at least one organization they focus on :thumbsup:</p>

<p>Mary’s Place announced today that Amazon will donate more than 47,000 sq. ft. of space within Amazon’s newest headquarters building as a permanent location for a Mary’s Place Family Shelter.
This first-of-its-kind partnership will include 65 rooms, which will shelter more than 200 homeless women, children, and families each night.</p>

<p>Very happy for Mary’s Place. Of course, this just reminds me of all the stuff I still had on my TODO for that hobby project!</p>
