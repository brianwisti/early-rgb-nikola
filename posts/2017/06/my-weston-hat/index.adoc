<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ended up knitting this one twice.
Tried the large size first, and it ended up way too large for my taste.
Frogged and restarted the smaller size, making a new set of mistakes.
But the hat fits now and I’m not starting again!</p>

<p>I went with the free <a href="https://www.garnstudio.com/pattern.php?id=7779&amp;cid=17">Weston pattern</a> by DROPS Design, using <a href="http://www.michaels.com/caron-cakes-yarn/M10481921.html">Caron Cakes Lemon Lime</a> yarn.
Mine doesn’t look much like theirs.
Different yarn causes some of that.
Mistakes in my cabling caused a little of it.
Not sure about that ribbing, though.
Mine measures correctly for the pattern, but looks <em>huge</em> compared to the sample image.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>I had to do some math for placing decreases from brim to body, as the pattern didn’t specify placement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Switched from circular to DPNs for the decrease at the top.
The pattern has three repeats, so you either need to be smart about placing your dpns —
which I did with the first version — or you need to use 3 dpns and be careful about ladders —
which I did with the second version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will probably want a shorter ribbed section than the pattern describes if you want to knit their hat and show off the cabling.</p>
