Ended up knitting this one twice. Tried the large size first, and it ended up way too large for my taste.
Frogged and restarted the smaller size, making a new set of mistakes. But the hat fits now and I'm not
starting again!

I went with the free [Weston pattern][] by DROPS Design, using [Caron Cakes Lemon Lime][] yarn. Mine doesn't
look much like theirs. Different yarn causes some of that. Mistakes in my cabling caused a little of it. Not
sure about that ribbing, though. Mine measures correctly for the pattern, but looks *huge* compared to the
sample image.

## Extra Notes

* I had to do some math for placing decreases from brim to body, as the pattern didn't specify placement.
* Switched from circular to DPNs for the decrease at the top. The pattern has three repeats, so you either
need to be smart about placing your dpns (which I did with the first version) or you need to use 3 dpns and be
careful about ladders (which I did with the second version).
* You will probably want a shorter ribbed section than the pattern describes if you want to knit their hat and
show off the cabling.
