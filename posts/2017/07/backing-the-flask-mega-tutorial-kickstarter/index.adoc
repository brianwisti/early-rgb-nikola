<p>Miguel Grenbergs’ <a href="https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world">Flask Mega-Tutorial</a> and <a href="https://flaskbook.com/">book</a> helped me understand using Python’s <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask microframework</a>.
Well, somewhat.
My understanding would improve if I used it more.
Haven’t taken advantage of the opportunity yet.
Anyways - of course I decided to back his <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1124925856/the-new-and-improved-flask-mega-tutorial/">Kickstarter</a> for updating the Flask Mega-Tutorial.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>His <a href="https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-kickstarter">blog post about the Kickstarter</a> reminded me that he was doing this.
I’m pushing it here because I know he creates great learning material.
Oh and because I still feel a little bad about sending him so many questions during the "rough cuts" phase of the Flask book.
Further endorsement: he was unfailingly polite and helpful responding to those questions.</p>
