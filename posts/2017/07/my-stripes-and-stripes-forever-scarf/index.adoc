<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is my version of the "Stripes (And Stripes) Forever Scarf" from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57512.Stitch_n_Bitch_Crochet">Stitch ’N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker</a>.
It came together quickly.
The only real challenge was getting the first row of single chains in.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Someday I’ll stick exactly to a pattern.
Today is not that day.
Here are the things I intentionally changed.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The pattern uses four colors, but I only had three I wanted to use for it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like longer scarves, so I added about six inches of length.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I skipped the fringe. It did not move me.</p>
</li>
</ul>
