<div class="paragraph">
<p>Trying to add Disqus comments once again.
I adjusted permalinks, since the old <code>/:section/:year/:title/</code> structure seemed to confuse Disqus.
Here’s hoping.
I assigned aliases to content so that old links should work.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I know.
I’m fickle about comments.
I want them, then I don’t want them.
I’d switch to WordPress but I’d have to untangle all the Hugo specifics that I’ve adopted over the last couple years.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Oh heck a week from now marks <a href="/post/2015/09/next-hugo">two years</a> since I switched to Hugo.
Either it got easier to use or I got used to it.
And every time I’m ready to look elsewhere they add something new.</p>
