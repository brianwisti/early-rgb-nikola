<div class="paragraph">
<p>Took me less than a week.
I like that.
On the other hand, I established for certain that when I knit fast my gauge loosens up.
The hat fits looser than it should.
I like that less.
On the <em>other</em> other hand, I already wear it most of the time.
It feels nice.</p>

<p>This pattern came from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/170305.Son_of_Stitch_n_Bitch">Son of Stitch ’n Bitch</a>.
I used <a href="http://www.yarnspirations.com/yarn/astra.html?super_attribute=YToxOntpOjQ1NjtzOjU6IjQ1NzA1Ijt9">Patons Astra</a> black and — uh — some white yarn of about the right thickness.</p>

<p>This pattern works for beginners, or someone looking for a break from their big complicated projects.
It might be easier if you knit in the round.
There would be less purling, if nothing else.
I may revisit this hat later knitting in the round, and either knit slower or use smaller needles.</p>
