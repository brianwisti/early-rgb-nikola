<div class="paragraph">
<p>Last month I read an article about <a href="https://muddycolors.blogspot.com/2012/08/duotone-illustrations.html">duotone illustrations</a> and decided to try a version of the technique myself someday.
Today was that day.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duotone">Duotone</a> uses two colors — usually black and a color such as blue or red — to make an image.
It was popular for a while in 20th Century illustration because it cost less than full color printing.
Skilled duotone illustrators like <a href="https://americanillustration.org/project/mead-schaeffer/">Mead Schaeffer</a> produced visually arresting images.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I wanted to manually create duotone images in sketch apps like <a href="/tags/procreate">Procreate</a>.
Time to describe what I came up with.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This post isn’t a tutorial, but the information may be useful to you.
For that matter it may be useful to <em>me</em>.
That’s really what this whole site is about, after all:
making life easier for future me, and hopefully maybe you too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I had a couple of self-imposed limitations while making this.
I deliberately chose to only use flat color for this experiment — no shading to speak of.
I also used a smaller canvas than usual.
It wasn’t a technical limitation, but it did limit the detail I could put into the image.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In retrospect, that’s probably a good thing for this experiment.
I ended up with about 50 layers the way I put things together, and this might have slowed my iPad down with a large image.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_linework">Linework</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first finished step is a solid black and white image.
It started out as a knotwork panel demonstration, but somewhere along the way I decided the panel needed extras.
Most of those extras came from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26311641-the-tangles-of-kells">Tangles of Kells</a>.</p>

<div class="imageblock">

<div class="title">Figure 2. Linework</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_values">Values</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then I put the values in, working from a grayscale palette.
Nothing fancy going on here.
The background is darker, the foreground is lighter, with a couple small variations along the way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I set the drop shadow layers to "Soft Light" so they wouldn’t obscure whatever was beneath them.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="duotone-panel-values.png" alt="Values">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 3. Values</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_color">Color</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For color, I created a new layer under the value layers, which I set to "Multiply."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here’s what that looked like, with everything else but linework cut out.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="duotone-panel-color.png" alt="Color">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 4. Color</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I had an initial stage where all the shadows were hatched lines.
Duotone didn’t occur to me until near the end of linework.
I’ll try value-based shading for everything in some future sketches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to have value mix nicely with color, I put each color layer beneath its value layer and set the value layer’s mode to "Multiply."</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_final">Final</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And that’s how I ended up with this.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_what_now">What now?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That was fun.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I want to explore duotone more, trying some specific ideas.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Shading instead of value blocks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use higher contrasting values.
This ended up just a tiny bit muddy to my eyes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiple color layers — tritone?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mixing grayscale values and color values in a style more similar to the duotone illustrations I like so much.</p>
</li>
</ul>
