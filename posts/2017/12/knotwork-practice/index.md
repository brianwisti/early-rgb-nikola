title: Knotwork Practice
year: '2017'
---
This started with practicing a knotwork pattern from [Celtic Art: The Methods of Construction][], and ended up
as an exercise in how long I could add stuff before I got bored. Thirteen hours. Not bad.

Not in a row, of course.

Oh and I threw in a couple tangle elements from [The Tangles of Kells][].

I might be ready to try drawing things on purpose again. Usually it's just that my hands get itchy when I see
blank space.
