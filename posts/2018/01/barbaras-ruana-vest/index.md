Finished this last month, but the blog fell behind a bit.
<!-- TEASER_END -->

The [Ruana Style Vest][] from Red Heart was one of my more ambitious knitting projects. Took me a little over
six months, including a few long breaks and a couple extended bursts of quick knitting that ended up requiring
more long breaks. Watch those wrists when you knit!
