I made myself a snug beanie hat by knitting in the round.
<!-- TEASER_END -->

I knit a [ski beanie][] back in November, using a pattern from [Son of Stitch 'n Bitch][]. The hat fit loose.
I thought this might be because the pattern is knit flat. I produce a tighter gauge when knitting in the
round. Would adapting the same hat to circular knitting produce a better fit?

Yes â€“ quite a bit! The yarn thickness and needle size were the same as the previous attempt. If I were to try
this experiment again I might use the next needle size up. A perfect fit would be somewhere in between this
and the beanie from November.
