I crocheted another "Boy Beanie" from [Stitch 'n Bitch Crochet][]. This time I followed the pattern!

<!-- TEASER_END -->

See, I left one of [my hats][] at a friend's place, where somebody promptly "borrowed" it. I liked the hat
better on them, and made another for myself.

Crocheting this took me under four hours, including a break to walk the dog. I impress myself.

Well I have to impress *somebody.* Why not me?
