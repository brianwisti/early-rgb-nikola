title: Random Geekery Telegram Channel
year: '2018'
---

I started experimenting with the [Telegram][] messaging platform. [Signal][] too, but Telegram's [API][] looks
like more fun.

[Telegram]: https://telegram.org/
[Signal]: https://signal.org/
[API]: https://core.telegram.org/api

There's a [RandomGeekery channel][]. For now you can think of it as equivalent to an RSS feed. I'm sure I'll
do other stuff with it later.

Oh and I post to it manually. Better add a task to the idea bucket.

[RandomGeekery channel]: https://t.me/RandomGeekery

```
$ task add +idea +code +site automate publishing to Telegram channel
