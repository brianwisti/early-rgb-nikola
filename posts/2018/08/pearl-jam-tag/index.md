Dog and I saw a [Pearl Jam][] logo tag while walking near [Easy Street Records][] this morning.

[Pearl Jam]: https://pearljam.com
[Easy Street Records]: https://easystreetonline.com

Probably something to do with this sign right next to the tag.

All right, so what does the sign mean by "Home Shows?" At first I thought it described some special in-store
event, since Easy Street has associated with Pearl Jam for a while. Last year the business marked the band's
induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by putting up a [pop-up store][] – a corner dedicated to the
band's music and so on.

Oh good. I found [an explanation][] on the band's site:

[pop-up store]: https://www.easystreetonline.com/NewsItem/6863
[an explanation]: https://pearljam.com/thehomeshows/seattle-wa

> Most of us grew up here. Over the past 28 years, the City of Seattle’s population has grown by 40%. The
> region's homelessness population is now the third largest in the country, with over 12,000 people living
> without shelter on any one night. This is not a number to be proud of.  
>
> As part of The Home Shows Initiative, more than 140 businesses, individuals, government agencies, and
> foundations are banding together to fight homelessness in King County. Join us. Take action and learn more
> about this crisis.

Nice. I knew Pearl Jam involved themselves in local homelessness issues – they [gave a donation][] to [Mary's
Place][] a few years back - but I forgot the name of their project.

The "Home Shows" that Easy Street Records is promoting are at Safeco Field, and unfortunately the venue sold
out. I guess not "unfortunately" since some of that money goes to support homeless people.

If you want to contribute to the Home Fund, you can always [donate][], or make a special day of it by going
out for food or beverages at a partner restaurant on Wednesday August 8, [Home Shows Restaurant Night][]. As
of the moment I write these words, that is tomorrow.

Anyways, yeah. I liked the tag. Dog had no opinion on the matter.
