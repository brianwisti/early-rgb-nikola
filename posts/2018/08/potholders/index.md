Yes, they look like that on purpose.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

A friend asked me to crochet a potholder based on an image she saw online. I tracked the image down to its
source: the "ManHandle Pot Holder" on Margaret Calver's [ayarnnut][] Etsy store.

The pattern wasn't too hard to figure out. I made several potholders as I worked through the process.
 
* chain a few - I settled on four
* increase at a pace you like until you reach the desired circumference
* single chain around until you reach the desired length
* single chain some texture where it looks about right

This description is deliberately vague because I made each potholder different, both for fun and because the
natural world is full of variety.

I shared images of the collection as I worked on it. Some people — okay, some *guys* — presented surprising
ideas for the intended usage. This is not a penis sweater. If nothing else, think of the chafing. And related
to their bold claims about needing one that was significantly longer: you don't want excess material flopping
uselessly. That's a safety hazard.

The potholder fits over the pot handle like so.

But you do you.

Want one? Crochet it yourself! Don't want to do that? [Buy one][] so the genius who came up with this idea
gets some money!
