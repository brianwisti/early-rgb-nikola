The [beorg][] iOS app has me playing with [Org mode][] again.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

[beorg]: https://beorgapp.com/
[Org mode]: https://orgmode.org/

This is not a review. This is me, excitedly sharing screenshots of the shiny thing I am playing with.

****

My [beorg][] screenshots are in the Dark theme, which is currently the only paid add-on for the app.
All functionality I look at today is part of the free core.
I'm perfectly happy putting out 99 cents if it helps development a little bit.

You can also contribute directly to feature development by making a contribution in Settings.

****

Does it support your favorite Org mode feature? I have no idea. But I can add, schedule, edit, and save tasks.

You *could* manage everything on your phone, but synchronization is an important feature for me. Synchronizing
org files via [Dropbox][] – or [WebDAV][] if that's more your thing – works in both directions.  I prefer
[Syncthing][] but I'll take what I can get. Who knows? Maybe I'll figure out WebDAV later.

## TODO view

The TODO view lists tasks, including clear indications of scheduled completion – assuming you understand the
notation.

The Rainer König [YouTube tutorials][] are great stuff. I'm going through them again myself for a refresher,
and I highly recommend them if you want to learn Emacs Org mode.

The TODO view supports multiple filters.

## Notifications

The app icon badge shows the count of overdue tasks.

Alarms pop up for deadlines.

I better wrap it up.

## Also

beorg includes other features I don't feel like looking at today.

The Agenda view integrates with your calendar events, which is both very handy and not
something I feel comfortable sharing with the entire world :smile:

The Files view gives you something closer to a raw edit of your Org files, but honestly that's pretty darned
clunky on a phone for me. For the moment I'll stick with high level task management on the phone, and Emacs
org mode if I need anything more involved.

## Anyways

Try out [beorg][] if you're on iOS. Read the [manual][] for a more in-depth look at features and usage. I'm
going to go reschedule that art project. I have other things that are higher priority.
