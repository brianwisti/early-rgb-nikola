title: Pretty Print Terminal Files With Bat

[`bat`][] is like a fancier `cat` for displaying file contents.

My work routine lately includes automatic generation of SQL files for
database updates. That routine includes quickly skimming them to find obvious
errors. I wanted something quicker than reviewing them in my editor, but fancier
than the simple plain text of `cat`.

I have the [Pygments][] syntax highlighting library for [Python][] installed, so I
could use `pygmentize` piped to `less` for paging:

``` shell
$ pygmentize -g work.sql | less -NR
```

However, that is noticeably slow and most definitely not convenient.  Adding an
alias helped the convenience, but did nothing for the sluggishness.

[`bat`][] provides what I need. It runs quick enough that I don't need to
think about it, highlights code, numbers lines, indicates git changes in the
margin, and feeds the result to `less` if there's more than you can display on
one screen.

Packages are available for several Linux distributions, or you can install it
via [Homebrew][] (reminder: Homebrew works on macOS *and* Linux these days).

``` shell
$ brew install bat
```

Oh hey there's something about the [Nix][] package manager on the `bat`
README. Adding a [Taskwarrior][] item to check that out later.

Sometimes I need to check the structure of files where whitespace matters:
tab-delimited files, Makefiles, Python, stuff like that. `bat -A` shows
whitespace and other non-printable characters displayed, though you lose syntax
highlighting.

## Plain Text

I enjoy the formatting conveniences from `bat` even when examining plain text
files.

This is all I've needed `bat` for, but it's flexible enough to work into your
everyday shell just like `cat`. Check out the [README][] for ideas.
