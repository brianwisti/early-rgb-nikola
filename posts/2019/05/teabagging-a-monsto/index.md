Yeah I know that's not what "teabagging" is.

So there was [a tweet exchange with a friend][] on Sunday.

I didn't think to ask for context. Context is generally unexpected on Twitter, and
sometimes downright unwelcome. Presumably Rachel's friend was interacting oddly
with monsters in a game. Or maybe not. I don't judge.

I still replied, of course. Even without context. We follow each other. We're
friends outside of Twitter. It *should* be okay.

Random note, since I'd still like this to be a useful post. Here are a few
guidelines for a happy life on Twitter.

* If you don't hear your name, don't come running.
* If you thought you heard your name, don't come running unless you know each
  other.
* Most important: save your dumb jokes for your friends, not the random
  strangers who get retweeted into your timeline. That ticks off the strangers.
* Remember you might tick your friends off sometimes too. Just try to be
  considerate.

Anyways. Overnight my mind wandered, and by Sunday afternoon the wandering had turned
into a sketch. I mean I know what [teabagging][] is. Be careful, that's an Urban
Dictionary link, and most definitely not safe for work.

But what if "teabagging" meant something else? What if it merely involved
fetching a fresh bag of tea for your friendly monster guest?

Being the sort of person I am, I had to embellish the script in [Procreate][]. And
then post it in the thread.

I'm not going to lie. I like this picture. Picked a small number of main colors and
adjusted saturation and brightness to build on those. The horns are great. And
that is a respectable teabag.

Perfect for teabagging the monstos.
