Grumbled on Twitter about the MBP TouchBar as a Vim user. [genehack][] mentioned
I could map Caps Lock to Control (my usual) *and* Escape, given the right tools.
Ten minutes later I had [Karabiner Elements][] installed, a keyboard rule imported, and
Vim happiness once again.

Definitely going to mess more with Karabiner.
