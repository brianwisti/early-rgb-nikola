The site's moved from [AWS][] to [Dreamhost][]!

[AWS]: https://aws.amazon.com
[Dreamhost]: https://dreamhost.com
<!-- TEASER_END -->

Nothing wrong with AWS S3 for static site hosting, but some of what I want to do
is easier to describe in a shell. Also â€“ I don't mind paying for a service, but
I got tired of usage-based billing. I ended up literally paying for typos more
than a few times. Give me a predictable bill please.
