[IndieWeb]: https://indieweb.org/

> Have fun. When the web took off in the 90â€™s people began designing personal
> sites with tools such as GeoCities. These spaces had Java applets, garish
> green background and seventeen animated GIFs. It may have been ugly and badly
> coded but it was fun. Keep the web weird and interesting.
