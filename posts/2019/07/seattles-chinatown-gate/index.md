Colors are a lot brighter in my new neighborhood. [The gate][] was dedicated in
2008 to celebrate the neighborhood's [history][].

That link also helps understand why "International District" and not just

> Japanese, Filipinos, African Americans, Vietnamese, Koreans, and Cambodians,
> settled together and built one neighborhood.
