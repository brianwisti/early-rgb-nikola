title: Wanting WSL 2
year: '2019'
---

Been impatiently waiting for the general release of WSL 2 -- the [Windows
Subsystem for Linux][]. What's interesting about WSL 2?

[Windows Subsystem for Linux]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about

> WSL 2 delivers a much faster file system performance and full system call
> compatibility, which lets you run more applications like Docker!

Looks like it's scheduled to go out in the first half of 2020.  So I can either
wait *several* months or switch my rarely-used Windows partition to the [Insider
Ring][].

I should at least wait until [Build 18917][] or later shows up in the Slow Ring
on [Flight Hub][].

[Build 18917]: https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2019/06/12/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-18917/#VhwdYU5EDiYa7XDx.97

*fidgets a lot*

We'll see.
