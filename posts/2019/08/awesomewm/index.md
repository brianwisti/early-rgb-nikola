There's been way too much "it just works (more or less)" in my desktop life lately, so I started using the
[awesomewm][] tiling window manager.

Disappointingly, it works just fine.

Still, good chance to learn enough [Lua][] to customize my setup. Looks like I'll be revisiting [Kitty
terminal][] and a few other tools that have been on the task list for a while.
