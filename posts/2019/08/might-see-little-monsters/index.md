I'm done with zombie movies.

*watches trailer*

ok I'm not quite done.

Reminds me of [Shaun of the Dead][]. Not in any specific notes, just the slapstick
gore and "what sort of hero could a (slacker, kindergarden teacher) be?" angle.

<aside> (red band, so gory. Also, it's a kindergarden teacher protecting kids
during an outbreak so maybe don't watch if that's a thing for you) </aside>
