Seattle's homeless sweeps are contentious to say the least.

From [The Seattle Times][], on July 9th:

[The Seattle Times]: https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeless/on-way-to-long-term-changes-seattle-mayor-jenny-durkan-quietly-clears-homeless-camps/

> Seattle removed 75% more homeless encampments in the first four months of this year than during the same period in 2018, even with this February’s record snowstorm slowing clean-ups.

[John Curley][] pointed out the NIMBY — "Not In My Backyard" — aspect:

> What they’re doing is they’re trying to push them out of view. So they’re sending them back behind railroad tracks, back behind buildings, back away from the general view.

Mostly I'm curious who'd be so offended by this wall art that they'd remove part of its message.
