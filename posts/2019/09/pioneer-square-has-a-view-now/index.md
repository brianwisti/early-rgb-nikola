We went out for dinner the other evening, and once the sun was no longer blasting directly in our eyes -- yay
for [precession of the equinoxes][] -- we were treated to a hell of a sight.

See, the [Alaskan Way Viaduct][] has blocked any real view of the Puget Sound from ground level since the 1950s.

Until they start building up that [juicy real estate][], of course. But I'll enjoy it while I can.
