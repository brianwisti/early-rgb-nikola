Probably my favorite comment about [Art Nouveau][].

Whoa. The Wikipedia entry mentions that it was called "Kalevala style" in Finland. Which -- looking elsewhere
-- might be a little off. I mostly see references to [National Romanticism][], which is a bit of a mixed bag
historically speaking. For Finland it was an urge to assert itself as a _nation_ and not just some dirt swapped
back and forth between Russia and Sweden. Writing down the [Kalevala][] was a part of that same movement.

And yeah [JRR Tolkien loved the Kalevala][], tying in another piece to hippy culture. I think every bookshelf
I saw as a kid had a copy of The Lord of the Rings.
