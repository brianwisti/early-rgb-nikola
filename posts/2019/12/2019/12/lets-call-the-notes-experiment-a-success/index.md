Yep. I love the [Notes][] experiment.
It encourages me to post quick thoughts frequently.

I'm officially assimilating [Notes][] into the main flow of the site.
That means [tags][] instead of their own taxonomy.
It also means they get listed with posts in the [archives][].

Got a few ideas for a tidy separation of the two, but for taxonomy and history we are back to one main flow.

[Notes]: /note
[tags]: /tags
[archives]: /year
