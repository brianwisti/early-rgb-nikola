I spent forty hours over the last month or so drawing this.

Couldnâ€™t decide which aspect I liked best. Line work? Color? Values? So
I went with all three.

On another note, I kinda want to study more about image formats. JPEG
clearly has some issues with the red. PNG is unacceptably large thanks
to all the detail work.
