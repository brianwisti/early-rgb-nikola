I spent forty hours over the last month or so drawing this.

Couldn't decide which aspect I liked best. Line work? Color? Values? So I went with all three.

On another note, I kinda want to study more about image formats. JPEG clearly has some issues with the red. PNG is
unacceptably large thanks to all the detail work.
