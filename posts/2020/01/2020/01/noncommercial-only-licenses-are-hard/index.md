> Let me be clear: I'm not arguing with the desire to pay developers in this system, I'm arguing that this is a
> non-solution. To recap, here are the problems with noncommercial:
>
> * What commercial/noncommercial are is hard to define
> * NC doesn't compose; a tower of noncommercial-licensed tools is a truly brittle one to audit and resolve
> * The appeal of NC is in non-compliance

For both content and software, it's just such a mess.
