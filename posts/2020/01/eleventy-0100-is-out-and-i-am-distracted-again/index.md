I love that there are so many great static site generators out.
I hate that I don't have enough time to try *all* of them.

But [Eleventy](https://11ty.io) has the possum logo.
Hard to argue with that.
Maybe I'll revisit with the [base blog][] template, or one of the other [starter kits][].
The [deep dive][] idea was a little ambitious, anyways.
