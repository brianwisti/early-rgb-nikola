Let me be clear: I’m not arguing with the desire to pay developers in
his system, I’m arguing that this is a non-solution. To recap, here
re the problems with noncommercial:

- What commercial/noncommercial are is hard to define
- NC doesn’t compose; a tower of noncommercial-licensed tools is a
 truly brittle one to audit and resolve
- The appeal of NC is in non-compliance

For both content and software, it’s just such a mess.
