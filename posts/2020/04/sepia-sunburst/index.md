Lots of folks stuck at home.

Feel like coloring something? I decided to share the linework for this
drawing.

{{< image-link name="sepia-sunburst-linework.png" >}}

Print it. Import it into your favorite coloring / sketch app. Whatever.
Have fun\!

And you don’t *have* to show me what you do with it, but I’d love it if
you did\!
