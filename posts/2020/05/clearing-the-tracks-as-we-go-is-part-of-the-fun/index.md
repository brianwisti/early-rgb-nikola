If I waited until I had the perfect toolchain for it, then I'd never start. Better to *just start typing* now, and see where my impatience carries me.

I agree. Sorry for the delay in replying. I needed to create and/or fake
the missing pieces of my workflow so I *could* reply.

And your reply came through just fine! Course, now I need to go fix the
bit where it’s not showing up on the note you’re replying to.

PS: I mentioned
[Boatmurdered](https://lparchive.org/Dwarf-Fortress-Boatmurdered/Introduction/)
in the tags. I’m not sure why.
