{{< card-link "Jason McIntosh" >}} seems like a reasonable choice to test Webmentions on. I wouldn’t
know about the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org) if not for him. I know
I’ll try his [Web::Mention](https://metacpan.org/pod/Web::Mention)
library eventually. But first,
[webmention-tools](https://github.com/Ryuno-Ki/webmention-tools).

The other stuff didn’t work and didn’t give useful errors. I ended up
using Web::Mention. It’s fine. Just half to rewrite half the post.
That’s fine.
