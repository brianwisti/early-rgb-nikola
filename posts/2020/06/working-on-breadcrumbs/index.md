[shortcode example]: https://gohugo.io/content-management/sections/#example-breadcrumb-navigation

Starting a new job on Monday, which is pretty exciting.
Also, figured out a whole bunch of breadcrumb and timeline stuff for the site, starting from
a [shortcode example][] I never noticed in the Hugo documents before.

Hoping I finish before I get all distracted on Monday.
