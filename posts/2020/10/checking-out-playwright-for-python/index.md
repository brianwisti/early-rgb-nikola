While automation is important, end-to-end tests are prone to being slow and flaky. To fix this, we
released Playwright in JavaScript earlier this year and have enabled thousands of developers and
testers to be successful at end-to-end testing. Today, weâ€™re bringing the same capabilities to
Python.

[Playwright]: https://playwright.dev

*Almost* made it to bed at a reasonable time until a random search showed me this.
I'd been glancing enviously at [Playwright][] earlier this year.
Configurable, cross-browser testing?
Nice.
Nicer than Selenium, anyways.

BRB rewriting all my browser tests.

My webmentions are all messed up.
Working on it, in my copious free time.
