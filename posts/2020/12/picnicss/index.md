From the [repo][] README:

> * Only CSS3 is needed and your HTML5 stays highly semantic (footnote: Except for the grids :()
> * Under 10kb when minimized and gzipped with all plugins.
> * Normalize.css is used as a base, achieving a solid foundation.
> * Support: IE 9+ and others. No fancy CSS3 on IE 8.
> * Responsive: The nav and the grids are responsive.

[latest redesign]: /note/2020/12/new-theme-for-2021/

Using Picnic CSS as the starting point for my [latest redesign][]. Small framework means easier to
extend with my own ideas.
