Think [Jupyter][], but simpler, reactive, and so far only for [Julia][].
Your notebook updates automatically.
It does push you towards a different notebook style, though.

I'm coming across all sorts of nifty code exploration environments these days.
Still can't wrap my head around an IDE, but give me a good notebook and I'm busy for days.
