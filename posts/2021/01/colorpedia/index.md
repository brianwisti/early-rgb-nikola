I heard of this about ten minutes ago and I already know it's going to be a fixture in my shell
toolkit. Look up a color swatch. Check out a color's shades. Grab the details of popular palettes.

Requires a terminal with good color support, obviously. Seems to work well with Windows Terminal and
Alacritty on Windows. I assume iTerm2 on macOS handles this. Many terminals to choose from on Linux.
