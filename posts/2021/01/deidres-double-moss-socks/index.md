Took me six months to make these.
It's a good thing she likes them!

## The pattern

Using [Sensational Knitted Socks][] by Charlene Schurch, as usual.
Been a while since I knitted any socks, so I went with a safe [moss stitch][] fallback.

## The yarn

brand
: Think Bamboo

style
: B917

color:
: 992

composition
: 45% bamboo, 40% wool, 15% nylon

site
: `https://thinkbamboo.com`;
  not set as actual link because it doesn't work for me at the moment

The yarn is pretty, and works nice once you get going.
It is beyond a hassle to wind up, though.
