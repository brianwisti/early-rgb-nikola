[Terence Martin][] posted a couple helpful videos, [explaining][] version licensing and the impending changes to the [Sublime Text][] text editor, and sometips on [getting started][] with "version 4."
So nice I watched them twice.

A real subscription, where you get to keep the builds you paid for.
I like this.

Okay, sure. Sublime Text isn't open source.
Version releases are few and far between.
But it's *good* â€”
the only graphical text editor I've used that feels as responsive as [Vim][].

I love supporting independent development when I can. 
A subscription approach is more sustainable for developers and more satisfying for users than the (extremely) intermittent bursts of version-based licensing.
There's nothing official, so I don't know what's really happening. The [Sublime Discord][] "announcements" channel holds the details.

Python 3.8.6. Good stuff!
