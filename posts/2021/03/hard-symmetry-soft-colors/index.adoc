<p>I don&#8217;t even know how many hours I spent on this.
An hour or two a night — but not every night — since November or so?</p>

<p><a href="https://linea-app.com/">Linea</a> takes a very constrained approach to tools.
No automatic symmetry.
No blend modes.
Only five layers.
Makes it feel like a paper sketch book, but with bonuses.
Their approach to color palettes is one of those bonuses.
I used their predefined "Art Deco" palette for this.</p>

<p>You can grab the line work yourself if you want something to color.</p>
