Bookmarked because hey it works in Alacritty for Windows too!
I haven't tried it in WSL or anything.
I just ran it from the PowerShell prompt via `npx`.

    PS > npx alacritty-themes

Might seem frivolous to some folks but now I can easily use a high-contrast theme
when the sun's right in my face every morning and something softer at night.
